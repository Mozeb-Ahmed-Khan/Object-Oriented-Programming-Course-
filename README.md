# Object-Oriented-Programming-Course-
This repository includes assignments, quizzes, and helping material of CS 1004 - Object Oriented Programming course.

## Course Overview
This Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course focuses on fundamental programming concepts using the object-oriented paradigm. Students will learn to model real-world problems using objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. The course emphasizes design principles and software engineering practices in the development of scalable and maintainable software solutions.

## Textbook Information
- **Main Textbook**: *Starting Out with Java: From Control Structures through Objects* (6th Edition) by Tony Gaddis
- **Reference Book**: *Object-Oriented Design and Patterns* (3rd Edition) by Cay S. Horstmann

## Course Content

### **Weeks 1 - 3**: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
- Topics:
  - Introduction to programming paradigms
  - OOP principles: Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
  - Classes and objects
  - Methods and constructors
  - Access specifiers: public, private, protected

### **Weeks 4 - 6**: Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Topics:
  - Single and multiple inheritance
  - Method overloading and method overriding
  - The `super` keyword and constructor chaining
  - Polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch
  - Abstract classes and interfaces

### **Weeks 7 - 9**: Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts
- Topics:
  - Exception handling in OOP
  - Packages and access control
  - Inner classes and anonymous classes
  - Enumerations
  - The use of final keyword in OOP

### **Weeks 10 - 12**: Object-Oriented Design and Principles
- Topics:
  - Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, Decorator)
  - UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams for OOP design
  - SOLID principles of object-oriented design
  - Coupling and cohesion in OOP systems
  - Refactoring code for better design

### **Weeks 13 - 15**: File I/O, GUI, and Collections
- Topics:
  - Input/output (I/O) in Java: Reading and writing files
  - Introduction to JavaFX and Swing for GUI programming
  - Using Java collections: Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues
  - Iterators and enhanced for-loops
  - Generics and type-safe collections

## Course Activities
- **Lectures**: Classroom instruction covering theoretical concepts and practical demonstrations
- **Programming Assignments**: Weekly programming assignments focusing on OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns
- **Labs**: Hands-on lab sessions where students will develop object-oriented applications and solve real-world problems
- **Projects**: A final project where students design and implement an object-oriented application, demonstrating the use of key concepts
- **Presentations**: Group or individual presentations on design patterns and OOP case studies

## Assessment Structure
- **Quizzes and Assignments**: Regular quizzes and assignments testing understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
- **Midterm and Final Exams**: Comprehensive assessments covering the theory and application of OOP principles
- **Project**: A final project applying OOP design principles to solve a real-world problem
- **Lab Evaluations**: Lab work is evaluated based on correctness, code quality, and adherence to OOP principles

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
- Understand and apply the principles of object-oriented programming
- Be able to design and implement software solutions using classes, objects, and inheritance
- Understand how to use polymorphism and interfaces to write flexible and reusable code
- Gain experience in applying object-oriented design patterns in software development
- Be proficient in writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code

## Lab Work
Lab sessions will provide students with hands-on experience in implementing OOP solutions. Labs will focus on applying class design, inheritance, exception handling, and advanced OOP features to real-world scenarios.
